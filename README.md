# Project-Five
Project five for the Treehouse Python course.

The application in the project lets the user add, edit and project information that is then displayed in the website. The project is built using Python and it uses the Flask framework and the SQLAlchemy tool. The html templates were provided by Treehouse.

To run the project locally a user needs to install the libraries that are listed in the Requirements.txt file. The user needs to create a virtual environment. 

In this project I learned how to use the Flask framework to create a simple website. I also learned how to use SQLAlchemy tool.
